```
✅ Added 'requests' library for HTTP operations
✅ Maintained all existing dependencies
✅ Ensured compatibility with Heroku deployment
```

#### File: `Procfile` - Deployment Configuration
**Changes Made:**
```

```
❌ Download Failed

Instagram is blocking requests. This usually happens due to:
• Rate limiting
• Content is private  
• Instagram API restrictions

⏰ Try again in a few minutes.
