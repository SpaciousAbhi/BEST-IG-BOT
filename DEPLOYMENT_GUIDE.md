   - Good performance for public profiles

🏅 Public Reels: ~60% success
   - Video content from public accounts
   - Moderate success due to restrictions

🏅 Public IGTV: ~50% success
   - Long-form video content
   - Limited by Instagram restrictions

```

### **User Experience Examples**

#### **Successful Download**
```
User: https://instagram.com/p/ABC123/
Bot: 🔍 Analyzing Instagram URL...
Bot: 📥 Downloading Post...
Bot: 🔗 Type: POST  
Bot: 📤 Uploading files...
Bot: ✅ Successfully downloaded and sent 3 files!
[Bot sends all images from the post]
```

#### **Story (Login Required)**
```
User: https://instagram.com/stories/username/123/
Bot: 🔐 Story Requires Login

Stories are private by design and only visible to followers.

Why login is needed:
• Stories and highlights are private by design
• Only visible to followers/account owner
• Instagram doesn't allow anonymous access

What you can do:
1. Coming Soon: Login with your own Instagram account
2. Alternative: Screenshot/screen record manually  
3. Try Instead: Look for public posts from the same user
